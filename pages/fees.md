# Fees


Mash Markets charges competitive fees to ensure an affordable trading experience. The fee structure is straightforward and aims to incentivize trading volume while maintaining the long-term sustainability of the platform.

### Fee Breakdown:
- **Flat base fee**: Applied to the **notional position size** of each trade. This ensures that larger trades pay proportionately higher fees.
- **Price impact fee**: Simulates the impact a trade would have on an order book, based on its size, and adjusts the fee accordingly.
- **Borrow fee**: Applied **hourly** to open positions, based on the notional size of the position.
- **Oracle fee**: For creating new price feeds or **custom oracles**, a fee is charged to support the maintenance of accurate market data.
