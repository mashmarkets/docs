# Vision

At **Mash Markets**, our vision is to redefine decentralized finance (DeFi) by making derivatives trading fast, accessible, and efficient. By leveraging the power of Solanaâ€™s high-performance blockchain, we aim to create a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to **build, trade, and profit** from derivatives in a **low-fee** environment, free from the limitations of centralized exchanges (CEXs) and traditional order books.

We believe that financial markets should be transparent, open, and permissionless, providing users with full control over their assets.
