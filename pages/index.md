## 1. Vision

At **Mash Markets**, our vision is to redefine decentralized finance (DeFi) by making derivatives trading fast, accessible, and efficient.

We believe in creating financial markets that are:
- **Transparent**
- **Open**
- **Permissionless**

Mash Markets empowers both traders and liquidity providers with the tools they need to thrive in the DeFi ecosystem.
