# Welcome to Mash Markets

# What is Mash Markets?
Mash Markets is created by two DeFi enthusiasts [Kosong0x](https://x.com/kosong0x) and [JsonMaxi](https://x.com/jsonmaxi).

Mash Markets is a trading simulation with periodic tournaments that reward the best traders. Compete against others to see who really is the best leverage crypto trader. At the end of the tournament, users are ranked based on their gains/losses and the top 10 profitable traders get a distribution of the prize pool with Mash Markets. Winners will be allocated Mash tokens as a reward.

# Where is Mash Markets hosted?
Mash Markets is fully hosted on the Solana Blockchain.

# How often are tournaments held?
Our inaugural tournament is being held on 20th January 2025. The tournament will last for 2 weeks and be held on the Solana Devnet.

# Do I need funds to play?
At this point Mash Markets is free to play on the Devnet.

---

# What do I need to play?
You will need a Solana wallet address to make on-chain transactions (on the devnet) and a valid email address.

---

# Are these real trades?
Trades on Mash Markets are simulated trades meaning that real capital is not risked on each trade.

# What happens if I get liquidated?
You have to wait for the next tournament or sign in with another email address and wallet address.

# What is a short? What is a long?
> **Going long** means you expect its price to go up. Your account benefits if the price rises.

> **Going short** means you expect its price to go down. Your account benefits if the price declines.

# What is leverage?
> When using leverage you can trade sizes that are bigger than the mUSD in your account. This can magnify both potential gains and losses.

> Mash Markets allows you to use up to 1000x leverage. This means that if you have a 10,000 mUSD balance, you can trade up to 10,000,000 worth of a token with 1000x leverage.

# How can I cash out my prize if I win?
Winners will be able to claim Mash tokens via the site. Mash tokens will be available to trade on Raydium pools on Token Generation Event (TGE).
