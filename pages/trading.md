# Trading

Mash Markets allows users to **trade perpetual futures** on their favorite crypto assets with up to **100x leverage**. Perpetual futures allow traders to speculate on the price of an asset without actually holding it, and positions can remain open indefinitely (as long as margin requirements are met).

### Trading Features:
- **Leverage**: Users can trade with leverage, amplifying their exposure to price movements. This feature is particularly attractive to traders looking to maximize their profits from short-term price swings.
- **Liquidity pools**: Traders execute trades against liquidity pools rather than a traditional order book. This means faster execution and lower slippage, even for large trades.
- **No order book**: The absence of an order book reduces the complexity of trading and ensures that liquidity is always available.
